# landing-page
“The whole secret lies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot fathom our real intent.”

The project will consist of a landing page, built ob a base of this template - https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png - provided by The Odin Project. This project should be a reflection of my skills as of finishing the CSS chapter of The Odin Project. Good Luck Me.
